        <div class="element">Building a computer can be a rewarding process, but it requires careful attention to detail and precision. The first step in the process is securing the motherboard to the computer case. Begin by aligning the motherboard with the pre-installed standoffs in the case. These small metal spacers prevent the board from short-circuiting by keeping it elevated from the case's surface. Make sure the I/O shield is installed in the back panel of the case before you screw in the motherboard. Once aligned, use screws to securely attach the motherboard to the standoffs. Ensuring everything is firmly in place provides a stable foundation for the rest of the components.</div>

        <div class="element">Next comes installing the CPU (Central Processing Unit), one of the most critical parts of the build. Start by lifting the retention arm of the CPU socket on the motherboard. Carefully align the CPU with the socket, ensuring that the golden triangle on the corner of the CPU matches the marking on the socket. Gently place the CPU into the socket without applying excessive force, then lower the retention arm to lock it in place. After the CPU is securely seated, apply a small amount of thermal paste on its surface. The last step is to install the CPU cooler, which will help dissipate heat during operation.</div>
        <div class="element">With the CPU installed, the next step is to install the RAM (Random Access Memory). Identify the appropriate slots on the motherboard, which are typically color-coded for dual-channel configurations. Open the retaining clips at both ends of the RAM slot. Line up the notch on the RAM module with the slot to ensure it’s oriented correctly, and gently press down until the module clicks into place, securing it with the retaining clips. Properly seated RAM is essential for your system’s performance, as it directly influences how efficiently your computer handles tasks.</div>
